<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
<!--
  How did you approach the overall design of the project?
  What resources did you employ at this stage to assist you in creating an overall design?
-->

<p>
  Ended up removing the LCD, as I didnt have enough pins, as well as the fact
  that I decided to control via Raspberry Pi over wifi, so the on-robot LCD
  screen seemed somewhat redundant.
</p>

<p>
  Used a motor from a previous project, which has an internal gearbox making it
  low rpm, in comparison to the motors which came with the course kit.
</p>

<p>
  I used old <a href="https://basicfun.com/knex/"><span> K'nex</span></a> which
  I had from when I was younger in order to build the majority of the robot.
  While some components didnt fit nicely, like the motor, I was able to create
  friction-based holders for them.
  <br />
  The aesthetics of the project sort of fell apart as I reached the final
  stages, as I needed a smooth surface for the wires linking the ultrasonic
  sensor to the arduino. The friction on the wires dragging was a major
  challenge, as it made the turn degrees vary, which made results garbled.
</p>

<h3>General Programming Considerations</h3>

<!-- 
  Were any special programming considerations required to implement your design? 
  Where did you seek resource information to assist in this process?
  -->

<p>
  While the control of the arduino was relatively simple to implement, the
  processing of distance data received by the ultrasonic sensor would likely be
  quite challenging to complete in arduino code. This led me to consider using a
  Raspberry Pi as a processing device, to allow for data organization in python.
  <br />
  Working with reading the serial output of the arduino in python, it was tough
  to get the timing right, as the arduino code had to be started prior to
  connecting the python serial monitor.
  <br />
  For drawing the mapped distances in python, I used the Turtle package, and
  frequently referenced the documentation found here:
  <a href=" https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"

<h3>Program Implementation</h3>
<!-- 
  Discuss your robot's programming. What major categories of robotic control did you implement? 
  What control approach did you employ to manage the overall control of your robot?
  -->
<p>
  My robot operates under reactive control, as it awaits a signal from the user
  in order to begin performing its functionality.

  <br />

  I used python for most of the data processing, and to interact with the serial
  input/output of the Arduino. When the program is run, the python code sends
  signals over USB to the Arduino, and the Arduino sends the distance
  measurements back.

  <br />

  Implementing the normalization of outlier readings was relatively complex, as
  I only have a basic stats foundation. It's not infrequent that the ultrasonic
  sensor fails to receive the return signal directly, and outputs an object way
  off in the distance. These faulty readings had to be eliminated/normalized in
  order to have a vauguely accurate map representation or floor space
  estimation.
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<!--
  Discuss your test approach, your test plan and test results. 
  That is, how did you test your robot and program to ensure you had met your design goals? 
  Discuss any deviations from your expected test plan output and what you did about this.
-->
<p>
  Timing the 360 degree turn of the motor with 720 distance readings at equal
  intervals took plenty of trial and error, as the servo was unable to rotate
  the required 360 degrees, so I used a geared motor I had from a previous
  project I'd worked on. While the low RPM of the motor was beneficial, lacking
  the position/state control of a servo made alignment and precision somewhat
  tedious.

  <br />

  Ended up adding a point of overlap (approximately 0.5 degrees of rotation, in
  order for complete scan to be properly drawn)

  <br />

  It took lots of trial and error working with the motor and ultrasonic sensor,
  as the wires made performing a complete turn quite challenging.
</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<!--
  Discuss the outcome of your project. 
  Did your robot meet all design expectations? 
  Now that you are done, what would you do differently were you to undertake the same project again?
-->
<p>
  Had there been a budget for the project, using lidar or some combination of
  sensors likely wouldve produced more accurate results than the current
  implementation which uses ultrasound.

  <p>
    [initial_border_drawing01.png] is an image generated using random data. One
    of the first tests of the border drawing code, where input distance data was
    generated with slight variations, and using python, the distances were drawn
    as a set of linked points on a coordinate plane.
